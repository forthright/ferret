# Integrations

You can integrate a number of services using Ferret's web service.

## CI

Ferret can integrate with a number of hosted CI services and essentially
provide a glorified Cron-like service.

### CircleCI

### AppVeyor

### Codeship

### TravisCI

TravisCI is great and already lets you set a daily trigger for your build server.

## Code Review

Ferret is intentionally designed to not be centred around any one code review
service. As mighty as GitHub is, there will (eventually) be support for other
services like BitBucket, GitLab, etc.

### GitHub

You can setup Ferret to set PR statuses everytime you push to a branch and upload a snapshot.
This will show you score differences, new issues and insights, coverage diffs, etc.

* show screen how to authenticate (not the github tokens)
* show screen how to create an integration

## Group Messaging

Receive notifications through extra services such as Slack.

### Slack

* screen showing how to get webhook
* show screen creating integration with webhook
