# FAQ

## Can I use Ferret without creating an account?

Of course! Ferret will **ONLY** upload data or interact with Ferret's web
API with your knowledge and consent, for example: when you
run something like `ferret analyze --commit`.

On its own you can use Ferret to statically analyze your projects,
view and manipulate metadata and issues locally,
and even run [traditional linter tools](editor/).

## Can I use Ferret without installing Node.js?

As long as you use the [pre-compiled packages](start/#installing-manually) or
[install from a package manager](start/#installation), you
don't need to have anything related to Node.js installed or configured.

## Can I use Ferret in my preferred programming language?

Currently no, as it would be a huge amount of duplicate work.

Ideally there will be many language implementations & native plugins that all ascribe to
the same metadata spec that Ferret's [web service](https://ferretci.com) API accepts.

## Why Node.js / TypeScript?

While there is most definitely a number of caveats, Node+npm+TypeScript provides a reasonable
and robust (typed) way to write a decently fast, cross-OS analysis library with concurrent plugin execution.

## How did Ferret start out?

It started out because of some frustrations with the restrictions and
focus of existing continuous analysis solutions.

The main goal of Ferret was to create an open, extensible, developer oriented,
build server agnostic multi-language platform that could help foster and transparently support the existing
open source community and tooling surrounding static code analysis and project maintenance.

## Ferret is (F)OSS, but not FerretCI?

Currently the code behind [ferretci.com](https://ferretci.com) is closed source.

As a project, a vital goal for Ferret is to fund it properly and with enough
margin so that there can be an actively paid team of developers and other
professionals supporting and growing the project.

Given this, the tried and tested way of providing a pay-for-private SaaS model (ex: GitHub)
seemed like an ideal one at the start. However, Ferret is a project
that I would rather have free and open compared to closed and ultimately driven for profit.

Other mechanisms of managing a "company" of creators, contributors and maintainers (ideally in a decentralized way
such as with [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com)) are definitely on the radar as well, and if enough users like the idea then
I believe it behooves the maintainers/creators to do so.
